What Happens When You Type https://www.google.com and Press Enter?
Have you ever wondered what really happens when you type a website address and hit Enter? It might seem simple, but your computer and the internet do a lot of work in just a few seconds. Let me explain it step by step!

1. Finding Google’s Address (DNS)
Your computer doesn’t understand words like “google.com.” It needs a special number called an IP address to find the website. So first, your computer asks a system called DNS (like the internet’s phone book) to find the address of Google.

2. Making a Connection (TCP/IP)
Once your computer knows Google’s address, it tries to connect to Google’s servers using a set of rules called TCP/IP. Think of it like making a phone call to the right number.

3. Passing Through Firewalls
Your request passes through several firewalls - these are like security guards that check if your request is safe before letting it through. This happens on your computer, your network, and Google’s side.

4. Securing the Connection (HTTPS)
Because you typed “https,” your browser and Google agree to talk privately using encryption. This keeps your information safe from hackers while it travels over the internet.

5. Sharing the Load (Load Balancer)
Google has millions of servers. To keep things fast and reliable, a load balancer decides which server will handle your request so no single server gets overwhelmed.

6. Handling Your Request (Web Server)
The chosen server receives your request and starts working on it. For Google’s homepage, it might just send back some simple files. For a search, it passes your request to another server.

7. Processing Your Search (Application Server)
This server runs the actual Google search program. It figures out what you’re looking for and gets the results ready.

8. Getting Data (Database)
To find the best results, Google’s servers look into huge databases filled with information from all over the web.

9. Sending the Results Back
Finally, Google sends the results back through the servers, load balancer, and internet, all encrypted and safe. Your browser receives the data and shows you the Google homepage or search results.

In Short
Typing “https://www.google.com” sets off an amazing chain of events involving address lookups, secure connections, smart servers, and lots of data - all in just a blink of an eye!
